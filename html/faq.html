        <h3>WHY?</h3>
    </header>

    <p>
        I...I don´t, I don´k know, I just keep walking, learning things, doing stuff; and hoping that someday I'll look
        back and, as Jobs said on the Stansford speech, watch how the dots end up matching WAIT! Maybe you mean WHY this
        website look like this, I could explain that:
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> Because I don´t see what's the point on filling up the net with the same dozen of cool stock photos over and
        over,
        and since "form follows function" (Sullivan. ae) I thought that creating my own illustrated desk, and putting
        every piece on its place with CSS, I'll be showing all my habilities at the same time. But I ended up violating
        nearly every UX law, so I hope this at least have make you laught a bit.

    </p>
    <p>
        And of course sometimes I regret doing this crazy nonsense; but I've done this in a week with my bare hands
        coding on
        an old computer, on hard sleep deprivation, and that makes me somehow proud of my weird creation.
    </p>

    <h4>Am I out of my mind?</h4>

    <p>Highly probably; but gurus keep calling it "Think outside the box" and it's such a trend now, so am OK with it.

        Anyway, on main, I'm just a quiet person who works tirelessly to achieve anything</p>

    <h4>What is my worst weakness?</h4>

    <p> I'm so afraid of failure that sometimes I overthink stuff before taking an important step, and it feels
        paralyzing</p>

    <h4>What are my strengths?</h4>

    <p>I'm a very good listener, a great speaker and not to mention I'm such a wonderful writer who never eats stinky brocoly at the office dinning room.</p>

    <h4>Where do I see myself in 5 years?</h4>

    <p>I really whant to know that too, I mean, sometimes I see a tiny bit of my future in deja-vu's but it's something
        like:
        <i> I'll be drawing an square on a notebook while someone says "I really dislike croquetas"

        </i>
        and 6 monts later it happens in that exact way, and I notice it.
        But if I were able to see myself in 5 years, I'll like to find myself being capable of creating my own content on
        the highest accessibility standard it could get, to make impaired people lives easier and furthermore, being happy.
